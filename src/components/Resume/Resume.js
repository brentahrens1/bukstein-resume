                    <p>
                        In summer of 2020, I began an advisory role at Ace Hotel to focus on my outside consulting work. My first client, the innovative eco friendly builder Hiatus Homes, is already making news with a cover story in Oregon 1859 Magazine.

                    <p>
                        Over the last two decades, I have helped lead the innovative, award winning brand team at Ace Hotel Group. As Vice President of Brand, I most recently helped spearhead the creation of two new hotel brands under the Atelier Ace umbrella: Sister City in New York City and Maison De La Luz in New Orleans. I also utilized my past experience working and studying in Japan to help lead the launch of Ace Hotel Kyoto.

                    <p>
                        My role included the oversight of partnerships on a global level, working with partners including: Headspace, Microsoft, Beams Japan, and Dropbox. My leadership in public relations strategy resulted in feature stories in The New York Times, WSJ Magazine., The Washington Post, Wallpaper Magazine, Travel + Leisure, Condé Nast Traveller and Architectural Digest Magazine to name a few.

                    <p>
                        Our marketing and event programming strategy helped drive successful openings and swift stabilization of hotels in New Orleans, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, and London. Always willing to take on new challenges, I also took a leadership role in the branding and operation of the historic United Artists Theater in Downtown Los Angeles. Pulling from my deep love of music, I oversaw the creative direction of Ace Hotel’s music program, including all in house piped music, playlists, and live events. My work led to collaborations with Bjork, Flatbush Zombies, Danilo Perez, Preservation Hall Jazz Band and more.

                    <p>
                        The first national growth phase of Ace Hotel saw our team taking on locations in New York, NY and Palm Springs, CA.  My role expanded to Director of PR and Marketing, while I continued to oversee public relations, marketing, event programming, partnerships, and web development. In Palm Springs, I led the development of an event programming strategy that helped drive a new wave of tourism and positioned Ace Hotel & Swim Club to grow into one of the region’s biggest success stories. Partnerships and public relations driven by my team contributed to Ace Hotel New York’s transformation of the Nomad district in Midtown Manhattan, called by NY Magazine a “hot neighborhood starter kit”.

                        As Ace Hotel was adding new hotel locations, we  were also growing the company’s retail business through product collaborations and storytelling around unique hotel products.  My product marketing and PR work helped drive the success of collaborations with Converse, Wings + Horns, Incase, Tokyo Bike and Reigning Champ.  Creative event marketing included a pop up shop with the Vancouver Art Gallery around the Grand Hotel Exhibition.

                        In 2006, I joined the small team creating the second Ace Hotel, in Portland, OR. Working as Marketing and PR Manager, I handled the public relations, marketing, and event programming for the launch of Ace Hotel Portland, while also project managing the design team. My work included the first of Ace Hotel’s Japan collaborations: The Inspired Travel Collection with Uniqlo and an event series with Travel Oregon to promote Portland as a destination. My brand marketing and public relations work helped Ace Hotel Portland become a significant media and financial success, receiving coverage worldwide including a large exclusive story in New York Times T Magazine.

                        My career started early in 2000 while still a student at University of Washington in Seattle. An internship with Neverstop, an award-winning experiential marketing agency, set up the opportunity for mentorship by Alex Calderwood, founder of Neverstop and Ace Hotel. I grew from an intern at Neverstop to a creative producer executing experiential marketing for clients including Gap, Banana Republic, Standard Hotels, Starbucks and Comcast.
