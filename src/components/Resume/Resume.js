                    content="As Ace Hotel continued to grow, Ryan was elevated to Vice President of Brand. While Ryan led the team to continue to drive exposure and revenue to the operating hotels, he also oversaw the opening of Ace’s first global locations. Atelier Ace created their first luxury product, American Trade Hotel in Panama City, Panama.  Working closely with Jazz legend Danilo Perez, Ryan worked to position this new hotel and jazz club alongside the storied history and culture of Panama City.  In London, Ace Hotel utilized it’s cultural lens to transform a crown plaza hotel into Ace Hotel London Shoreditch.  Collaborations with Moog, London Design Festival, and more helped define the Ace brand in Europe and as the Financial Times put it 'its careful, well-designed confidence allows it to slot into Shoreditch with deceptive ease. But, more importantly, it has given London back a bit of its streetscape that seemed lost forever.'"
